Goal: To create a feed that recaps the events of my dog's day based on her activity with user's that I invite to the program. Want to be able to code each event type i.e.; walks, feedings, etc., to be able to be refined and collated by type at set timing increments. 

Backend Needs: Want to have a map add on feature that maps distances and time spent walking that can also be collated and pulled by set time increments, i.e.; by day, by week, month. 

Needs:
- Sign in be via facebook so that user photos are visible
- Mapping feature 
- Ability for users to log an event and then update things that happened on the event. Ex: Log a WALK and on that walk, dog PEED + POOPED or just PEED, etc. 
- Image based event type coding i.e.; poop emoji, water emoji, food emoji.
- A place to store information for all walkers like Vet info, closest animal ER, dog's microchip information etc.


Wants:
- Square cash or Venmo add on to pay walker as needed
- Chat feature so you can request walks of other users in your dog's network
- Ability to upload photos into the feed of each walk
- Ablitiy to set push notifications to the "admin" or master user when an event occurs in the dog's day or when it has been x amount of time since event in dog's day. Ex: set an alert that if my dog does not log a walk for 10 hours to send a text to the master user.
